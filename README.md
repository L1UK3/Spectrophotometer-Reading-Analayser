## Spectrophotometer Output Visualiser

This project provides a web-based tool for visualising and analysing output data from a spectrophotometer. Users can upload text files containing measurement data, which are then parsed and displayed as interactive graphs. The tool is designed to make it easy to inspect, plot, and interpret spectrophotometer readings directly in the browser without having to use outdated specialised software.

Includes:
- Static webpage hosted on github pages:

- Initial python script that outputs the graph of a text file in the directory using matplotlib
```
